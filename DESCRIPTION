Description: Provides tools for Bayesian basket trial design and analysis using a novel three-component local power prior framework with global borrowing control, pairwise similarity assessment and a borrowing threshold. Supports simulation-based evaluation of operating characteristics and comparison with other methods. Applicable to both equal and unequal sample size settings in early-phase oncology trials.
